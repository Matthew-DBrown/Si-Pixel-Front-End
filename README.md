# Si-Pixel-Front-End
A pulse shaping front-end from discrete, off-the-shelf components for a diode acting as a pixel for particle detection. 

This project project investigates the feasibility of using a diode as a pixel, where its depletion width is the active region where particles may interact, such as cosmic rays.
The output from the diode is expected to be a sharp current pulse that needs to be shaped to be digitally counted. This calls for the design of a front-end pulse shaping circuit for which the KiCad files and outputs can be seen in this project.

Included files:
-- KiCad Schematics
-- PCB Layout (future proposals)
-- Breaboard and waveform images
