## The Diode Pixel

Under reverse bias, a diode will output current when a charged particle traverses through the depletion region, though in reality, this is difficult to set up. A depletion length must be sufficiently wide that when multiple diodes are used, the probability of a particle interacting is non-negligible. A potentially suitable diode is a Zener diode which handles reverse breakdown voltage without damage and conducts a sizeable amount of reverse current. Below is a typical illustration of a diode under reverse bias with a depletion width in the centre.

A depletion width is seen in traditional CMOS technology used in advanced particle detectors. The image below from 'Microelectronic Circuits - Theory and Applications' by Sedra/Smith illustrates the depletion region seen in n-type CMOS transistors.
