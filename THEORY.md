## The Diode Pixel

Under reverse bias, a diode will output current when a charged particle traverses through the depletion region, though in reality, this is difficult to set up. A depletion length must be sufficiently wide that when multiple diodes are used, the probability of a particle interacting is non-negligible. A potentially suitable diode is a Zener diode which handles reverse breakdown voltage without damage and conducts a sizeable amount of reverse current.
