## Analogue Front-End Components
### Integration and Initial Shaping

The first stage of the analogue front end is to integrate the input charge with an active integrator. As established, the input signal must be amplified, and the integrator can achieve this
with RC values less than unity, according to,

. The input charge will be proportional to
the energy of the detected particle, hence the integrator’s importance in particle identification.
The choice of capacitance is informed by the total charge injected from the input pulse. The
current can be obtained by dividing Eq. 31 with the resistance through which the charge in-
jection capacitor discharges, set to 18 Ω (Sec. 5.5.1), and the injected charge can be obtained
by integrating the current over the pulse width, T=100 ns.
